# blocnotes

Just another sort of pastebin for the moment, nothing fancy. Supports Markdown
though.

## Install

`git clone` it somewhere with http access. make shure the http server has write
access to `admin` and `admin/notes.db`, and read access to `engine.php`,
`index.html` and `client.js`. Then access through `index.html` online. In case
something goes wrong with the DB, you can go in `admin` to get a sql web
interface. Be shure to set the password in `admin/phpsqliteadmin.config.php`.
